It’s bad idea to hold emotional attachment to any technology.  
Separating a technology from personal affinity is huge point of growth.  
Most of great truths we already know, we simply need to be reminded of them.

You own your career:

* Know what you’re actually good at.
* Know who you want to be in 5 years.
* Check where you are in these goals.
* Take intentional instead of reactive learning approach. Do you have a roadmap for the next thing you want to be?
* Don’t jump around from job to job just for the sake of small raise or because you got mad at someone.

Developers are often problem solvers by nature and they focus on problems and call them out.

There are limited times to disagree, use them wisely.

When someone asks a question, it is helpful to let them finish and repeat the question back.

Taking critics:

* Noone is perfect, including you.
* You’ll probably hear about it sometimes.
* Most likely there will be poor delivery of criticism.
* Most likely you will receive it poorly.
* Don’t simply ignore what they say.
* Don’t make it hard to give you feedback.

Leaders who don’t listen will soon be surrounded by people who have nothing to say.

Guard your workload.
